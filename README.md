## Documentation

***üìò Overview***

The system allows users to order customized paint mixtures with precise color accuracy, while an admin interface monitors paint levels and machine operations in real-time through a connected web application using firebase database. This machine can also be monitored though the machine interface when the machine faced problems in the internet connectivity.

### ***üîß Key Features***

- üß† IoT Integration: Real time monitoring of canister paint levels via web application using firebase.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Dispensing System: Uses stepper motors, mechanical check valve, syringe, and solenoid valve.

- üíª Admin Dashboard: Built with CTkinter and Python for tracking paint levels and controlling the mechanism when doing maintenance.

- üí° Purpose: To innovate the paint mixing industry.
